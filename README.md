# Human Social Protocol

A decentralized protocol designed to verify that all users are human — without relying on centralized authorities or corporations.

## 🌍 Mission
Build a globally accessible, censorship-resistant identity layer for the World App and other decentralized platforms.

## 🔒 Key Features
- Proof-of-Humanity without government IDs
- Biometric + Liveness check integration (e.g., face + motion)
- On-chain or zk-rollup proofs to validate humanity
- Zero knowledge to protect user privacy
- Fraud + Sybil resistance using multi-step onboarding

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [x] Set up frontend project structure
- [ ] Create biometric liveness check (JS + WebRTC)
- [ ] Build smart contract for on-chain proof
- [ ] Integrate wallet connection + identity verification
- [ ] Deploy MVP to testnet

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Vite + React (frontend)
- Solidity / zk-SNARKs / or verifiable credentials (backend)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- IPFS / Filecoin for decentralized storage
