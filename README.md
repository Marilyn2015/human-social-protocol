# Human Social Protocol 🌍🧬

The **Human Social Protocol** is a decentralized identity verification system designed to ensure that all users interacting within global apps (like World App) are **verifiably human**.

## 🔐 Purpose

With the rise of AI, bots, and deepfakes flooding digital platforms, **verifying real human users** is more critical than ever. This protocol aims to create a **universal, privacy-respecting human verification layer** that can be integrated across decentralized apps and platforms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned / In Progress)
- Web3 / Blockchain identity primitives
- Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
- Vite + React (frontend)
- IPFS / Decentralized storage
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## 🧠 Vision

Imagine a world where:
- **Only humans** can vote, comment, and interact in decentralized spaces.
- AI bots and synthetic identities are **filtered out by default**.
- You don’t have to sacrifice your privacy to prove your humanity.

We’re building a **protocol**, not a platform — an open infrastructure layer for any decentralized service to integrate.

## 📈 Project Status

> ✅ Initial frontend scaffolded  
> 🔄 Backend and blockchain layer in design phase  
> 🧪 Proof-of-humanness models under review
